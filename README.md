## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to showcase how users can turn their ideas into art with the help of Artificial Intelligence. 
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This interactive workshop allows participants to explore the combination of creativity, AI, and programming through art. Using tools like Processing, Java, and DALL-E, participants create personalized images based on their input and then color and design their ideas on an interactive canvas.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
Artify AI is an interactive digital art platform powered by generative AI, designed to make digital art accessible to users of all skill levels. By entering text prompts, users can generate AI-assisted images, experiment with RGB color theory, and personalize their artwork. The platform encourages creativity through features like RGB customization, brush size control, and AI-generated templates, allowing users to explore artistic expression and fundamental computing concepts. A key focus of Artify AI is demonstrating how AI can be used creatively, with prompt engineering playing a crucial role in guiding the AI to generate specific, high-quality artistic results. Users learn how the wording and structure of prompts impact the final output, showcasing AI's potential for creative tasks. Artify AI has been showcased at several events, including the Atlanta Science Festival and TAP Expo, where it received valuable feedback from participants. These experiences highlight the importance of integrating AI education into creative and technical learning environments. Moving forward, workshops will be conducted in ITEC classes at Georgia Gwinnett College, where students can practice prompt engineering and explore digital color manipulation. These sessions aim to assess how AI tools can enhance creativity and technological literacy, helping students refine their artistic and technical skills.

<a href="https://openai.com/index/dall-e/">DALL-E AI</a>
An AI model that generates images from textual descriptions. It will be used to create art templates based on participant-provided prompts.


Why we chose Processing: It is easy to use and helps participants create interactive and visual art while learning programming concepts. This makes it ideal for engaging participants in both art and coding.

Why we chose DALL-E: It allows for fast and creative image generation based on participant prompts, making the process fun, interactive, and highly engaging.

## Workshop Instructions 
1. Introduction: We’ll start by introducing ourselves and explaining our roles in the Artify AI project. We’ll give a brief overview of the platform, highlighting its key features like prompt engineering and RGB color manipulation.

2. Pre-Survey: We’ll then distribute a pre-survey to gauge your understanding of digital art and AI before we dive into the session.

3. Presentation: We’ll present a few slides to walk you through how Artify AI works and how prompt engineering helps guide the AI to create specific images. There will be trivia questions throughout to keep things interactive.

4. Hands-On Instructions: After the presentation, we’ll show you how to access Artify AI and guide you through the platform. You’ll either complete some challenges or have free time to experiment with the tool.

5. Post-Survey: Once you’ve explored Artify AI, we’ll hand out a post-survey to gather feedback on your experience and what you learned.

6. Closing: Lastly, we’ll thank you for your time and participation, and encourage you to keep experimenting with Artify AI. We’ll also inform you about any future workshops or opportunities.
