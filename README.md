## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to showcase how users can turn their ideas into art with the help of Artificial Intelligence. 
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This interactive workshop allows participants to explore the combination of creativity, AI, and programming through art. Using tools like Processing, Java, and DALL-E, participants create personalized images based on their input and then color and design their ideas on an interactive canvas.

<!-- 
Your Options for target audience: 
  - High School
  - College
  - Middle School
  - K-12
  - Non-Stem
  - Undergraduate
You can select from a range of audiences or a single auidience. Examples: 
    Middle School - College 
    High School - College
    K-12
  You will be presenting most often to your peers who are taking introductory technology classes, so more often than not you should be including college in your target audience range.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
Artify AI, an interactive digital art platform powered by generative AI. The project allows users to create and personalize artwork by simply entering text prompts, which the AI then translates into detailed outlines for coloring. This platform encourage creativity and accessibility, enabling users to engage in digital art, regardless of their skill level, from beginners with no experience but creativity, to professionals. Through RGB customization, brush size control, and AI-generated templates, Artify AI introduces users to both artistic expression and fundamental computing concepts.

</p>
<a href="https://openai.com/index/dall-e/">DALL-E AI</a>
An AI model that generates images from textual descriptions. It will be used to create art templates based on participant-provided prompts.


Why we chose Processing: It is easy to use and helps participants create interactive and visual art while learning programming concepts. This makes it ideal for engaging participants in both art and coding.

Why we chose DALL-E: It allows for fast and creative image generation based on participant prompts, making the process fun, interactive, and highly engaging.
